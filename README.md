# ContainerManager
Simple Maya Container Manager

**Uses only Maya's OM2 Python API**
****
As the maya container UI, is extremly frustrating, 
I wrote a simple and intuative UI for container interaction, 
and easy to use wrapper module for containers.
****
The container module can also be used to easily modify containers
* Add / Remove Container
* Add / Remove Objects in a container
* Expose/Hide Objects in a container
* Select the container that a selected asset is contained to
